# fdf
## Graphical isometric map visualisator
This project consists in creating graphically the schematic representation (in wireframe) of a field in relief linking different points (x, y, and z) with segments. The field's coordinates will be saved in a file passed in parameter.

(Unfortunately, we had to work on a custom MLX for this project so this only compiles on MACOSX with the custom MLX)
